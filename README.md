# CS478_Team_Project

This is a game I created called "Glop". This was a project I completed with my team for CS478 - Software Development. 
The project was built in Unity 2020.1.4f1. I was responsible for creating the main title screen and the pause screen 
and managing the levels by making sure that the right level was entered once the goal was reached or the player died. 
I also came up with the gameplay concepts and backstory.

I wrote some of scripts for the game in C#.
